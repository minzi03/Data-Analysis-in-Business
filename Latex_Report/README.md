## ðŸ“‘ Report Content Highlights

- **Datasets:** Historical daily stock data (2019â€“2024) from Investing.com for three pharmaceutical firms (*DHT, DP3, AMV*).  
- **Models:** Statistical (LR, ARIMA, FFT), ML (LightGBM, LR-CF-DP), DL (RNN, GRU, LSTM).  
- **Results:** Performance comparison using RMSE, MAPE, MSLE across 30-, 60-, and 90-day horizons.  
- **Findings:** LSTM achieved **MAPE < 3.5%**, outperforming classical models (ARIMA â‰¥ 30%, FFT â‰¥ 60%).  
- **Applications:** Investment decision support, risk management, and portfolio optimization.
