## File Descriptions

### 🔹 `Report.tex`
- The main LaTeX document of the project.
- Written in **IEEE OJIES** style.
- Includes:
  - Title, author information, and affiliations.

  - Tables and figures describing descriptive statistics, regression plots, and forecasting results.

### 🔹 `ieeeojies.cls`
- Class file that defines formatting rules following the **IEEE Open Journal of the Industrial Electronics Society** style.
- Ensures correct margins, fonts, title formatting, and bibliography style.

### 🔹 `bibliography/`
Contains reference libraries in BibTeX format:
- **`IEEEabrv.bib`** – Standard IEEE journal abbreviations.
- **`IEEEexample.bib`** – Example references for formatting guidance.
- **`IEEEfull.bib`** – Full IEEE bibliographic entries.

## Report Content Highlights

- **Datasets:** Historical daily stock data (2019–2024) from Investing.com for three pharmaceutical firms (*DHT, DP3, AMV*).  
- **Models:** Statistical (LR, ARIMA, FFT), ML (LightGBM, LR-CF-DP), DL (RNN, GRU, LSTM).  
- **Results:** Performance comparison using RMSE, MAPE, MSLE across 30-, 60-, and 90-day horizons.  
- **Findings:** LSTM achieved **MAPE < 3.5%**, outperforming classical models (ARIMA ≥ 30%, FFT ≥ 60%).  
- **Applications:** Investment decision support, risk management, and portfolio optimization.
