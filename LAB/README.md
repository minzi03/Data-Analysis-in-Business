# ðŸ§ª LAB Documentation

The **`LAB/`** directory contains practical exercises and supporting datasets designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge from the *Data Analysis in Business* course. Each lab focuses on a specific topic in statistics, probability, regression, or time series analysis, combining both **Microsoft Word reports** and **datasets/notebooks** for hands-on practice.
