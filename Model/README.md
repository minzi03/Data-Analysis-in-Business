## 📘 Model Descriptions

### 🔹 Statistical Models
- **Linear Regression (LR):** Baseline model to capture linear relationships between time and stock price.  
- **LR-CF-DP:** Extended linear regression with Calendar Fourier terms (seasonality) and Deterministic Process (trend).  
- **ARIMA:** Captures autoregressive and moving average components in time series data.  
- **FFT:** Identifies cyclical patterns and dominant frequencies in stock price movements.  

### 🔹 Machine Learning
- **LightGBM:** Gradient boosting decision tree model, efficient for handling non-linear relationships and feature interactions.  

### 🔹 Deep Learning
- **RNN:** Sequential model capturing short-term dependencies in time series.  
- **GRU:** Variant of RNN with gating mechanisms, more efficient for long sequences.  
- **LSTM:** Advanced recurrent architecture addressing vanishing gradients, proven effective for 30-, 60-, and 90-day forecasts.

## 🛠 Utilities
The `utils/` folder contains reusable scripts:
- **data_preprocessing.py** – Cleaning, normalization, and train-test split functions.  
- **evaluation.py** – Metrics including RMSE, MAPE, and MSLE.  
- **visualization.py** – Functions to plot predicted vs. actual stock prices.

## 📑 Training & Evaluation Workflow
1. **Preprocess data** using utilities (normalization, feature engineering).  
2. **Train models** with scripts inside each subfolder.  
3. **Evaluate performance** using RMSE, MAPE, and MSLE across multiple horizons (30, 60, 90 days).  
4. **Save models** into `saved_models/` for reproducibility and deployment.

## 📈 Example Results

- **LSTM** achieved **MAPE < 3.5%**, outperforming ARIMA (≥30%) and FFT (≥60%).  
- **LightGBM** provided competitive accuracy with fast training times.  
- Statistical models (LR, ARIMA) served as interpretable baselines for comparison.
